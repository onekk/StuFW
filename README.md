# StuFW 3D Printer Firmware for simple Atmel AVR boards

## Version 0.0.3 revision 20200819

## Why another firmware?

It is an hard question, after many request on the forum for help in setting up some basic and economic printers, some people have decided to fork the good MK4Duo and strip of all the complicated features and leave only some basic requirements:

-- Motherboards, RAMPS and cheap all in one derivative board.
-- Mechanic Cartesian and CoreXY, no delta, scara and so on
-- Display 
  - RepRapDiscount Full Graphic Smart Controller
  - RepRapDiscount Smart Controller

-- Driver A4988 and DRV8825
-- No exotic features, case led and so on
-- sensor to detect end of filament (microswitch)
-- autolevelling sensor capacitive or inductive

### Features

Forked from MK4Duo 4.3.8 revisione 19042019

### new branch "development" as wip place - WARNING usually the code in the development branch is broken as it is a WIP.

As soon the code is mature enough a new milestone will appear in the form of [version]-dev as a possible example 0.0.6-dev
