This also allow recalibration of the distance between the two endstops// without modifying the firmware (through the "M218 T1 X???" command).// Remember: you should set the second extruder x-offset to 0 in your slicer.// There are a few selectable movement modes for dual x-carriages using M605 S<mode>//    Mode 0 (DXC_FULL_CONTROL_MODE)        : Full control. The slicer has full control over both x-carriages and can achieve optimal travel results//                                            as long as it supports dual x-carriages. (M605 S0)//    Mode 1 (DXC_AUTO_PARK_MODE)           : Auto-park mode. The firmware will automatically park and unpark the x-carriages on tool changes so//                                            that additional slicer support is not required. (M605 S1)//    Mode 2 (DXC_DUPLICATION_MODE)         : Duplication mode. The firmware will transparently make the second x-carriage and extruder copy all//                                            actions of the first x-carriage. This allows the printer to print 2 arbitrary items at//                                            once. (2nd extruder x offset and temp offset are set using: M605 S2 [Xnnn] [Rmmm])//    Mode 3 (DXC_SCALED_DUPLICATION_MODE)  : Not working yet, but support routines in place//// This is the default power-up mode which can be later using M605.#define DEFAULT_DUAL_X_CARRIAGE_MODE DXC_FULL_CONTROL_MODESee if this conditionals could be modified#define HAS_POSITION_FLOAT      (ENABLED(LIN_ADVANCE) || ENABLED(SCARA_FEEDRATE_SCALING))WHAT ARE THESE?  #define X_TILT_FULCRUM Z_SAFE_HOMING_X_POINT  #define Y_TILT_FULCRUM Z_SAFE_HOMING_Y_POINT#else  #define X_TILT_FULCRUM X_HOME_POS  #define Y_TILT_FULCRUM Y_HOME_POSVerify these GCode leftovers * G17  - Select Plane XY (Requires CNC_WORKSPACE_PLANES) * G18  - Select Plane ZX (Requires CNC_WORKSPACE_PLANES) * G19  - Select Plane YZ (Requires CNC_WORKSPACE_PLANES) * G33  - Delta geometry Autocalibration (Requires DELTA_AUTO_CALIBRATION_?) *          F[nfactor] p[npoint] Q[debugging] (Requires DELTA_AUTO_CALIBRATION_1) *          P[points] [F] [O] [T] V[verbose] (Requires DELTA_AUTO_CALIBRATION_2) * G34  - Set Delta Height calculated from toolhead position (only DELTA) * M3   - S[value] CNC clockwise speed.
